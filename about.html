		<p class="about"  id="about-first">I’m a junior at the University of Michigan from Clarkston, Michigan. I’m in the School of Information studying data analytics, while also receiving a minor in German and a minor in business from the Ross School of Business. As someone who’s inspired by big picture ideas, I’ve used my time as an undergraduate to dive deep into the inner workings of data analytics and business, as well as develop my leadership skills to be able to provide valuable contributions to my teams to make our goals a reality. 
		</p>
		<p class="about" id="about-second">I’ve always loved planning, and I’ve used my undergraduate experience to learn how to effectively manage several types of projects. I've had the privilege over the past two years to serve as the University of Michigan’s Apple Campus Representative, where I’ve planned marketing initiatives to connect Apple’s solutions to students. I’ve done everything from wellness challenges to balloon walls, engaging students with Apple technology. As the Vice President of Big Ticket Productions, I’ve had the opportunity to run 3 large-scale concerts at Hill Auditorium. As a member of the University Activities Center E-Board, I executed the UAC Showcase, a multi-faceted performance from 16 different student organizations. Through all of these outlets, I’ve developed my project management skills and had the time of my life.</p>
		<p class="about" id="about-third">When I’m not planning my next event, you can find me at a concert, brushing up on my German, travelling, or trying out all of the restaurants in town. I love live music, and I never miss a chance to see my favorite artist or hang out with my friends while discovering the next big talent. Ideally, having tried out a new restaurant beforehand. I’m always down for a challenge, and I’ll try anything at least once.
